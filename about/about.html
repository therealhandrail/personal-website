                <h1>About Me!</h1>
                <div><img src="../content/038.JPG"></div>
                <p> I was born right here in Lewsiton, Maine! I'm a huge music nerd<br>
                    I play in two bands, one is an indie-punk band called Sorry Safari,<br>
                    and I have a few other projects that include Disco covers, hardcore<br>
                    punk, and country.<br><br>
                    Aside from music, I am a full-time graphic designer, where I design
                    <br>logos, branding, magazines, and display ads. I have been getting into
                    <br>real gamer nerd stuff lately, playing the likes of Dota 2, Ghost of Tsushima,<br>
                    and Baldur's Gate.<br><br>
                    My favorite food is Ramen, when I travel, I made it my mission to try all the<br>
                    ramen places, in hopes to find the Ramen that will change my life. For little<br>
                    hobbies, I love to draw (even though I am quite bad), I play men's league hockey<br>
                    as a goalie, and I ski every day that it's "too dangerous to drive to the office"<br><br>
                    As for my coding experience, I taught myself HTML and CSS around covid,<br>
                    as graphic design jobs were few and far between. I fell in love instatly<br>
                    and knew that I would love to make a career out of it someday.<br><br>
                    I feel this website is the limit of my coding knowledge. I tried to learn<br>
                    Javascript on my own but it was very hard knowing where to start. I'm hoping<br>
                    with this class I will have that 'guided learning' experience. I definitely<br>
                    love to do research on my own, but I feel I need to be pointed in the right<br>
                    direction at times. Also, I can copy Script and have it run, but I struggle<br>
                    when it comes to writing script, because my brain just doesnt have that<br>
                    programming mind yet.
